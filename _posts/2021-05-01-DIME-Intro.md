## What is DIME ?

The DIME (DyWA Integrated Modeling Environment) approach is a consequent refinement of the realization of jABC4 for process modeling and DyWA (Dynamic Web Application) for data modeling, empowering prototype-driven application development. More Simply, DIME is a programming less environment to easily design accomplish and contribute your ideas for a Web Application.DIME provides a family of Graphical Domain-Specific Languages
(GDSLs), each of which is tailored towards a specific aspect of typical
web applications, including persistent entities (i.e., a data model), business
logic in form of various types of process models, the structure of
the user interface, and access control.
