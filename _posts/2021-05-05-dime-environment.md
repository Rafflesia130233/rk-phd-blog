## DIME Environment
This tutorial provides a short overview of the DIME user interface as well as more details on the structural properties of the various models and on features supporting the developer during modeling.DIME is based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) and developed with the Cinco SCCE Meta Tooling Suite. As an RCP application, DIME consists of a set of plug-ins for the Eclipse framework that provide support for effective model editing and specific views3 on models in the current workspace. DIMEâ€™s view components provide dense overviews as well as quick access to the models, their components, and to detailed model information.
